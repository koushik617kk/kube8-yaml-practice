I learned about service and created them ClusterIp and NodePort

Theory
1. Every node will share smae virtual env, Creted by CNI So pods will share same kind of subnets and soo everything is accessable 

2. As we know loadbalancer is a abstraction of nodeports, But loadbalcner will not be having nay idea that node have specific port or not so   flow will be like  loadbalancer --> NodePort --> KubeProxy --> Pod

3. CNI is very important need to learn about it more

Syntax

1. Not clusterIp it is ClusterIp,NodePort
2. spec:
     type:
     selector:
     ports:
     - port:
       targetPort:
       nodePort:
