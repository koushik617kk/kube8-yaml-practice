So i learned deployments
List of things i corected
Theory
1. no need of a pod name only label is enough when we are creating a deployment
2. selector is what makes deploymnet know which pods it should manage so selctor label and template label (pod label) are important
3. Services will use same label to connetc to pods 
Syntax
1. apiVersion: apps/v1
2. ports:
   - containerPort: 80
3. selector:
     matchLabels: 
       app: kk

   template:
     metadata:
       app: kk
